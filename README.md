# INCIDENT DETECTION LABS REPORTS

## Objective

The Incident Detection Reports are aimed to showcase my learning experience in detecting and documenting cyber attacks during my course modules at Coursera. The primary focus was to read files, ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, and audit/report the complete walkthrough experience. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Analytics and Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Cybersecurity Auditing · Vulnerability Assessment · Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) · Security Incident Response

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Linux and MySql to save, engage and protect data.

## Explanation

## Tasks
Incident analysis, Documenting events, Network traffic assessment, OS vulnerability investigation, Risk management, and Vulnerability identification.
## 1.Vulnerability Assessment Report.pdf
In this Vulnerability Assessment report, I defined the system's hardware, software, and network configuration, the scope of the period using the NIST framework, the purpose of the assessment, the risk assessment, the approach for potential threats, and the remediation strategy by use of AAA and Encryption.
## 2.Risk Register.pdf
In this Risk Register, I assessed the risk of assets and classified them based on the likelihood of happening, severity of impact, and priority classification. I also noted that Likelihood x Impact Severity = Risk.
## 3.Security Incident Report OS.pdf
In this OS incident analysis report, I record an attack on the HTTP protocol that had been interfered with, a malicious attacker had added a source code that redirected clients to another website. This was done through a file disguised as a browser update. Some recommendations included using stronger passwords as the entry was a brute force attack and also using 2FA for additional authentication.
## 4.Security Incident Report Network Traffic Analysis.pdf
In this network traffic report, I analyzed the tcpdump logs of all packets flowing through the network, defining the SRC, DST IP, and Ports, and unreachable communication through port 53 caused by a DoS attack on the DNS server. I also noted notable flags too. Some notable protocols attacked were highlighted too.
## 5.Complete Incident Report Analysis.pdf
In this Incident report, I highlighted a phishing attack, and how it was identified, detected, reported, protected, and contained. The recovery method used as I also passe along some recommendations.
